There was not easily found documentation regarding what each spec gained over another, so I wrote this program to do so for the Lexus GS 350 Luxury trims.

This program could be easily modded by changing the set names and definitions.

I used sets because of the ability to use set operations (difference) on the overlapping data.

Trim specs are found at the link below. A copy of the website at time of development is attached in the repository.
